# Furniture-App-UI

Welcome to the Furniture App UI in Flutter repository! This repository contains the source code for the user interface of a furniture app developed using the Flutter framework.

The app features a clean and modern design, with a focus on easy navigation and user-friendly interactions. The UI includes the following pages:

* <b><i>Home page:</i></b> Displays a list of featured furniture items, as well as categories for browsing the full catalog.
* <b><i>Product page:</i></b> Provides detailed information about a selected furniture item, including images and product specifications.
* <b><i>Cart page:</i></b> Allows users to view and manage their selected items before checkout.
* <b><i>Checkout page:</i></b> Facilitates the process of placing an order, including the ability to enter shipping and payment information.

The UI is built using a combination of Flutter's built-in widgets and custom widgets created specifically for this app. The code is well-organized and commented, making it easy to understand and customize.

The app also uses flutter plugins like Flutter_svg and flutter_staggered_grid_view which are used to create beautiful and responsive UI.

Feel free to use this repository as a starting point for your own furniture app or as a reference for building UI in Flutter. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. <b><i>Happy coding!</i></b>
